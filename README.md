# Laravel DDD Core Sample

Welcome to the **Laravel DDD Core Sample** project! 

This repository showcases the implementation of domain-driven design (DDD) principles using Laravel and the [mariodevv/ddd-core-sample](https://packagist.org/packages/mariodevv/ddd-core-sample) package as its foundation.

We’re building this project incrementally, growing both the domain logic and the supporting infrastructure as we go. Stay tuned for new releases as we expand and refine the architecture—we’re just getting started!

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

### Domain Logic
This project is built around a solid core of domain logic, following the DDD methodology. Expect clean, modular code designed to solve real-world business problems effectively.

### Infrastructure
We’re progressively implementing a robust infrastructure to support the domain logic. Every iteration brings new tools and capabilities to the table, making it easier to adapt and scale.
